	<h2>Who We Are</h2>
		<p> Here at The Optimist, we believe the good is just as important to be informed about as the bad.
		Yes, there are crazy things happening in the world; Yes, many of these things are out of our control; Yes, there are injustices happening everywhere everyday.
		But, there are also good things happening everyday. They are also out of our control. There are steps towards justice and peace everywhere everyday.
		At the Optimist, we believe in restoring faith in humanity by bringing attention to the good.
		This is not an anti-news news app, this is not an anti anything app.
		Here, we are for the human race in all aspects. 
		Wherever there is a positive light to shed, we will be there to bring you the story that brings a smile to your face today.</p>
